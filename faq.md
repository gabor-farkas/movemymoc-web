# Frequenlty Asked Questions

## Why no Lego trees and baseplates?
They don't look good.

Lego trees have a layered structure, that looks nice in a Lego city setup, but when viewed from the side from a car's perspective, they are rather annoying.

The many studs on the baseplates would add a lot of geometry detail that would degrade the not-too-optimized performance of the game. If I let cars bump on them, then that would be annoying, if car wheels go through them, then that would look strange. If we use just a texture in place of actual stud geometry, it looks even stranger when viewed from a low angle.

Base plates also wouldn't play nicely with the free terrain editing available in the game.

## Will this be on mobile / console?
Not soon. Many of the game features aren't easily portable to a device that doesn't come with both a keyboard and a mouse. In the model configurator and the level designer screens there are so many options and control available that is tricky to adapt to a touchscreen in a really usable way.

Also, the main focus of the game is letting people import their models that were designed most likely in Bricklink Studio. This is possible most conveniently on a desktop, where Studio runs.

Having sad that, it could make sense to have a variant of the game that doesn't include the detailed model configurator and level designer screens, but just lets users select from already designed models and maps.

In the future, when Steam Workshop integration or some other mechanism will let users share their models and map in a central way, this could make more sense.

## How does it handle big models?
In short: don't plan import your full city models and multiple thousand-pieces detailed cars.

This of course depends on your computer's resources, but the game doesn't apply much optimization on the imported models. This will likely improve in the future, but please don't take this as a promise that the game would eventually handle millions of parts in a single scene.
